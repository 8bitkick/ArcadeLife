# ArcadeLife
A fast, interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life using vanilla Javascript / HTML5 canvas

## Intro
ArcadeLife is fully interactive, runs 60fps @ 4K on a reasonable machine and is fun to play around with for a bit, which is what I needed it to be :) 

## Background
I was updating my personal webpage and thought an interactive background would be cool. Remembering the <a href="https://twitter.com/bbcmicrobot/status/1230644568326053888?s=20">classic tweet</a> that Eben Upton sent to the <a href="https://www.bbcmicrobot.com">BBC Micro Bot</a> inspired me to try one based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Life<a/>. Note there are more playable implementations, and better optimized ones too (see <a href="https://dotat.at/prog/life/hashlife.c">Hashlife</a>).
